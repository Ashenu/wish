**1. What is a code repo and why we need them**

### What is Repo
+ A repository is a container to track our files.
+ A container is just like a folder and the rest is where we put a file.
+  Repository have 2 types, local repository and remote repository.
+ The repository created by our computer is a local repository and a repository created on a platform that hosts git hub is called a remote repository.

#### Why need them
+ GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code through repositories.
+ Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real-time.
+  Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.

**2. Prominent code management tools in the industry**
+ Prominent code management tools in the industry include:

    1. **Git**: Widely used for version control and collaboration.
    2. **GitHub**: A platform built around Git, offering hosting, collaboration features, and community.
    3. **GitLab**: Provides similar features to GitHub, including version control, collaboration, and CI/CD pipelines.
    4. **Bitbucket**: Offers Git and Mercurial version control systems, along with collaboration tools.
   5. **Subversion (SVN)**: Another version control system, although less popular compared to Git-based solutions.

   **3. What is the use of Readme file and gitignore**
   1. **Readme file**: Provides essential information about the project, including its purpose, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines.
 It helps users and contributors understand the project quickly and effectively.

   2.  **Gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This includes files generated during the development process, such as compiled binaries, 
temporary files, and sensitive information like API keys. Gitignore helps keep the repository clean and prevents unnecessary files from being tracked and shared.
